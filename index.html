          <h2>About Me:</h2>
          <p class="vertical-align">
            Hello, full-stack web developer here. The technologies I currently
            use are MongoDB, Express, React, MySQL, and NodeJS. I'm a non-stop
            learner and always leveling up my skills. Lots of experience working
            with people due to my customer service and sales background. In
            every place I've worked, I've come up with ways to work more
            efficiently and close more sales which my coworkers also benefit
            from implementing.

        <p>
          Both of these applications were developed using Mongo, Express, and
          Node. Through these projects, I was able to learn about concepts such
          as database optimization, crud, and how to add security to the
          application with authorication and authentication.

            >Campgrounds Application:</a
          >
          For this application I used the EJS Templating Engine. This was a
          great project to learn how to take advantage of the NPM package
          manager, especially when it comes to security. In this application,
          you can view a list of campgrounds posted by users. You can make your
          own account and post new campgrounds or leave reviews. Each campground
          has a name, location, price, description, the user that posted it, and
          images. All the information about the campground can be updated or
          deleted by the user who posted it.
        </p>

            >Workouts Application:</a
          >
          For this application I used React. It's a very simple application that
          allows you to save each excise that you do. It tracks how long ago it
          was posted, the weight, reps, and exercise name. Users have access to
          their own information and it's protected from other users.
