        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p class="vertical-align">
          Hello, I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. The technologies I
          currently use are Mongo, Express, React, and Node. I'm eager to
          specialize in any skill that would provide value for your company.

      <p>
        Both of these applications were developed using Mongo, Express, and
        Node. Through these projects, I was able to learn about concepts such as
        database optimization, crud, and security are applied to applications.

          >Campgrounds Application:</a
        >
        For this application I used the EJS Templating Engine. This was a great
        project to learn how to take advantage of the NPM package manager,
        especially when it comes to security. In this application, you can view
        a list of campgrounds posted by users. You can make your own account and
        post new campgrounds or leave reviews. Each campground has a name,
        location, price, description, the user that posted it, and images. All
        the information about the campground can be updated or deleted by the
        user who posted it.

          >Workouts Application:</a
        >
        For this application I used React. It's a very simple application that
        allows you to save each excise that you do. It tracks how long ago it
        was posted, the weight, reps, and exercise name. Users have access to
        their own information and it's protected from other users.
